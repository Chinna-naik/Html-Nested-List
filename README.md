# Html-Nested-List
💻✨ Just Designed a Simple HTML Food Menu Web Page! ✨💻

I'm excited to share one of my beginner-level web development projects — a Food Menu page built using only HTML. This mini project helped me understand the basics of structuring content using headings and lists in HTML.

📋 Project Overview:
I created a simple food menu that displays both Veg and Non-Veg items. Here's what I used:

🟢 Headings – For organizing menu sections like "Veg Items" and "Non-Veg Items"
🟢 Ordered Lists (<ol>) – To number the menu items
🟢 List Items (<li>) – For each dish
🟢 Unordered Lists or custom types – To separate categories

🧑‍🍳 Menu Structure Includes:

✅ Veg Items:
1.Paneer Butter Masala
2.Vegetable Biryani
3.Masala Dosa
4.Palak Paneer
5.Veg Noodles

🍗 Non-Veg Items:

1.Chicken Biryani
2.Mutton Curry
3.Egg Fried Rice
4.Fish Fry
5.Chicken Lollipop

🧠 What I Learned:
✅ How to use HTML tags like <h1>, <ol>, <li>, and <body>
✅ Nesting and organizing items properly
✅ Clean indentation and structure for readability
✅ Difference between ordered and unordered lists
✅ Writing semantic and readable code

🔧 Tools Used:
1.HTML5
2.VS Code (Text Editor)

🌱 This is one of my first steps into the world of Frontend Web Development.
